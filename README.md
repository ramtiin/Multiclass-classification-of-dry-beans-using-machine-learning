"# Multiclass classification of dry beans using machine learning" 
This report focuses on the development of two multiclass classification models using computer vision and machine learning techniques to classify dry beans. The study aims to provide a method for obtaining uniform seed varieties from crop production, which is in the form of population, so the seeds are not certified as a sole variety. The primary objective is to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification.
